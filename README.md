- 👋 Hi, I’m @Outmytree
- 👀 I’m interested in Quality Control Management Software for Construction
- 🌱 I’m in over my head being here, but hey, I have nothing to loose!
- 💞️ I’m looking to develop a plug-ins for Building Information Modelling (BIM) software
-    such as AutoDesk Revit, Graphisoft Archicad, and others...
-    that will be able to extract the data such as specifications from the model
-    and translate that into a Quality Control Plan (QCP). 
-    Theres more to than that. The software will have to understand how the model 
-    will be put together in reality. It will require users to take action and sign off 
-    that the work is correct. It could go as far as using cameras to determine if, for example
-    a wall is straight, the correct brick was used. Even further, the software could recieve inspection
-    data from hand held bluetooth sensors that check humidity, or laser measures.
-    Thats the first hurdle.
-    The second hurdle is that the QCP should not be a linear process, but rather a web
-    of nodes and connections. Nodes store the requirements of each object from the model translated
-    into standards that need approval, be that a human sign off of a checkbox, or a value provided by a
-    measuring instrument, or a visual approval from a camera that verifies according to a database of acceptable images.
-    The third hurdle is the user intervention. Users will still have to sign off each node (object), or could sign off
-    a cluster of nodes as a unit (family).
-    For example, A user may do spot checks on random bricks (objects/nodes), and then sign off a cluster bricks like a wall
-    (family/cluster).
-    A BIM model is already very advanced with a host of attributes assigned to objects. Adding another layer should be simple.
